### Context Addressing 

- Context Functions instead of hash functions |
- Distributed Context Tables instead of DHT |
- Context Engineering <br>    i.e. creating individual context functions |


--- 
### Context Functions 

- Functions which can associates anything <br>    to one kind of binary structure |
- functions define binary representations |
  - one strand of bits represents information 
  - one strand of bits represents relevance
