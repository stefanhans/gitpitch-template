### Decentralisation


Note:

Network of Isomorphic Applications Operating on Peer Devices

- Distributed systems instead of client-server topology |
- Isomorphic clients need bootstrap server at most  |
- User devices are the only alternative to the big cloud providers |

- edge aware infrastructure |
- encrypted by design |
- protocol-based and language-agnostic |
- plugin architecture |
- suitable for blockchain and ai |

### Generalisation


- Bitcoin -> Ethereum
