### Decentralisation

Network of Isomorphic Apps <br>
Operating on Peer Devices

- Distributed systems instead of client-server 
- Isomorphic clients need bootstrap server at most  
- User devices as alternative to big providers 
- Edge aware infrastructure 
- Protocol-based and language-agnostic 

---

### Generalisation


- Bitcoin -> Blockchain-based computing
- Cloud -> Decentralized OS
- Data silos -> Decentralized data exchange
- Web 2.0 -> Web 3.0
