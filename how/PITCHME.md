### Decentralisation

Network of Isomorphic Applications Operating on Peer Devices

- Distributed systems instead of client-server topology 
- Isomorphic clients need bootstrap server at most  |
- User devices are the only alternative to the big cloud providers 
- Edge aware infrastructure 
- Protocol-based and language-agnostic

### Generalisation


- Bitcoin -> blockchain-based computing (Ethereum)
- Cloud -> decentralized OS (IPFS, )
- Data silos -> decentralized data exchange
