# crossroad with fundamental directions, inconsistent situation, situation with contradiction, between distributio and concentration


A tipping point is like a crossroad with fundamental directions. And tipping points occur in inconsistent situations, situations with contradictions.

For me, the main inconsistency in the domain of distributed systems is between distribution and concentration.
